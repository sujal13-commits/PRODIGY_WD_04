              <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics
                and Telecommunication at Vivekanand Education Society's
                Institute Of Technology. I have a strong passion for new
                technologies and innovation, and I enjoy exploring emerging
                trends that shape the future of the tech world. My academic
                journey is driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to
                build solutions that make a real impact. Through this portfolio,
                I aim to showcase my skills, projects, and continuous growth in
                the field.

            <h3>Automated Vaccum Cleaner</h3>
            <p>
              <span>Problem Statement:</span><br />
              Manual vacuum cleaning is time-consuming and requires constant
              effort, making it inefficient for daily use in busy households or
              large areas. There is a need for an automated solution that can
              clean independently and adapt to different environments.
              <br />
              <span> Description:</span><br />
              An automated vacuum cleaner is a smart device that cleans floors
              with minimal human effort. Using sensors and programmed
              algorithms, it navigates spaces, avoids obstacles, and adjusts its
              cleaning path. Compact and efficient, it saves time while
              maintaining a clean environment.

            <h3>Writing Machine</h3>
            <p>
              <span>Problem Statement:</span><br />
              Manual writing tasks can be repetitive, time-consuming, and prone
              to human error, especially when large volumes of text or precise
              handwriting are required. There is a need for an automated system
              that can write accurately and efficiently without human fatigue.
              <br />
              <span>Description:</span> <br />
              A writing machine is an automated device designed to replicate
              human handwriting using programmed instructions. It consists of a
              mechanical arm or motorized setup that holds a pen and moves
              across paper to write text line by line. Controlled by
              microcontrollers and preloaded data, the machine can produce neat,
              consistent writing, making it ideal for applications like note
              replication, exam writing for differently-abled individuals, or
              repetitive documentation tasks.

            <h3>NanoVoice: ESP32-Powered AI Companion</h3>
            <p>
              <span>Problem Statement:</span><br />
              Traditional voice assistants often rely on cloud processing, which
              can lead to latency, privacy concerns, and dependence on internet
              connectivity. There is a need for a compact, offline-capable, and
              affordable AI-powered voice assistant that can function
              efficiently in real-time using minimal hardware resources.
              <br />
              <span>Description:</span> <br />
              NanoVoice is a compact AI companion powered by the ESP32
              microcontroller, designed to offer intelligent voice interaction
              without relying heavily on cloud services. It integrates
              components like a MEMS microphone, speaker, and I2S-based
              amplifier to enable real-time voice recognition and response.
              Using lightweight AI models and efficient edge processing,
              NanoVoice performs tasks such as answering queries, executing
              commands, and providing audio feedback. Its portability, low cost,
              and offline capability make it ideal for smart home control,
              educational tools, or personalized assistants in embedded systems.
